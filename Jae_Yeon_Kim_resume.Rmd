--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Causal Inference and Machine Learning [[GitHub](https://github.com/jaeyk/ITS-Text-Classification)]

PhD Candidate 

UC Berkeley 

Fall 2019 - Present

- Demonstrated how machine learning can help create critical data for causal inference by combining text classification and interrupted time series design
- Presented at [the 2019 Data Science Showcase](https://bids.berkeley.edu/events/fall-2019-data-science-showcase) at UC Berkeley

### Statistical Modeling of Time Series Data [[GitHub](https://github.com/jaeyk/regression-analysis-with-time-series-data)]

PhD Candidate 

UC Berkeley

2016 - 2018 

- Identified causal effects of the reduced government support on community organizing by collecting [original organizational data](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/FLUPBJ) and modeling time-series data  
- Ensured the reliability of findings by doing robustness checks and running sensitivity analysis

Graduate Student Researcher

UC Berkeley

Summer 2018 - Present

- Cleaned and wrangled a large-scale panel survey data, conducted multivariate and hierarchical regression analyses, and visualized results
- Imputed missing responses using multiple imputations and validated key survey constructs using factor analysis
